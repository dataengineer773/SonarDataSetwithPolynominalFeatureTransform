We can apply the polynominal features transform to the Sonar data set directly and in the next step we evaluate the same KNN Model as the previous section but in this case on a polynominal features transform of 
the dataset , we can see that the polynominal features transform results in a lift in performance from 79.o percent accuracy without the transform to about 80.0 percent with the transform
